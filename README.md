# Motion Tracking With Python, Opencv and Kalman Filter

In this projet, i try to tracking motion with opencv 3.4
For that i use background subtraction.

## Background subtraction
Background subtraction is critical in many computer vision applications.

We use it to count the number of cars passing through a toll booth. 

We use it to count the number of people walking in and out of a store.

And we use it for motion detection.

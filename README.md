# Motion Tracking With Python, Opencv and Kalman Filter

In this projet, i try to tracking motion with opencv 3.4
For that i use background subtraction.

## Background subtraction
Background subtraction is critical in many computer vision applications.

We use it to count the number of cars passing through a toll booth. 

We use it to count the number of people walking in and out of a store.

And we use it for motion detection. We use the first image of video and we maintain it static

with black color, and for the erea where the emotion is detected we can see white color
